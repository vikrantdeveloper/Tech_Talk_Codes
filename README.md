# Application Firmwares
The repository contains source codes implemented in various open-source tech talks and basics peripheral source code for various microcontrollers such as PIC16Fx, adafruit open source board , arduino uno

The firmwares for various MCU/ open source boards are ideal for begineers for getting started with embedded systems.The repo is ideals for folks who are getting started with embedded systems primarily with Arduino, raspberry pi, 8-bit register level programming PIC.

The projects:-
      
      *Autonomous robot - A python script that can be controlled autonomously or manually. It interfaces with a camera and streams video to the local server.
      
      *esp32 freeRTOS session - How to get started with freeRTOS task.
      
      *open-source firmware for DIY sensors in Arduino
      
      *Smart Parking System using RF-ID EM18 Sensors. 
      
      *GSM Based Arduino Door lock system using SIM 900.
      
      *PIC 16F887xx microcontroller register level programming for various peripherals.
      
Happy Learning :))
